## Meeting 11/5/2025

gemma jordan and I met today to discuss my pipeline practice i did last week. We looked at the barplots and saw that the mocks are unidentified (makes sense, as I used an aussie classifier from katherine) and that some of the other samples are not well identified. In response, were going to re do it with the hubbard brook classifier just as a test.
